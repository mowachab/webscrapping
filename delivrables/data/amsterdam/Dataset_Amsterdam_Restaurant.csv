Ocaña’s cuisine is tasty and direct without any artificial sophistication. It is based on the quality of the products. The dishes are inspired by the Catalan gastronomy and incorporate a nice dash of fusion elements. With a simple but surprising cuisine and a selection of liquors which leads to great discoveries, Ocaña is a place where guests can experience the rhythm of the new Barcelona that stirs and shakes under the tourist city: romantic, roguish and underground.","Vegetarian friendly",,,,"Ceviche","Burger","Paella","Tapas","Salad","Tacos","Mussels","Patatas Bravas","Croquettes","Seafood

Place of worship of intellectuals and artists of the time, it was the first refuge of inspiration for Pablo Picasso. In 2008, it was chosen by Woody Allen to host one of the main scenes in its film 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona', dedicated to the city. All this cultural and historic experience comes with exceptional gastronomy. All the dishes are prepared with proximity products and cooked with all the care and passion by our chef.

Lasarte is Martín Berasategui's cuisine embassy in Barcelona. After a full renovation carried out recently, the new Lasarte Restaurant is surprisingly much more modern and with more spacious and bright look. The emphasis on light, textures with dominance of oak and selection of furnishings have been the mainstay of the entire project to give the restaurant a unique personality. The culinary offer keeps the essence of Martin Berasategui's cuisine. At the head of the kitchen is Paolo Casagrande, who presents a selection of Berasategui's signature dishes with passion and enthusiasm, as well as new innovative dishes created especially for Lasarte. Joan Carles Ibáñez and his front of house team are the kitchen's ambassadors in the dining room and responsible for ensuring this wonderful cuisine reaches the table in a simply perfect way to make any visit a celebration. The restaurant has a semi-private room in the main dining room and a second private dining room, called the Chef's Table for up to 8 people -located in a loft over the kitchen with a glass wall that allows our guests to follow on all staging and creativity of the dishes.","Vegetarian friendly","Vegan options","Gluten free

The deceptively easy dishes earn their place with the choicest cuts of meat imported from Ireland. The vibe? Grown up, relaxed, playful. The setting? An opulent room you'll feel at home in, only better. In how many places can you get a perfectly cooked rib-eye steak with immaculate flavour, crisp triple cooked chunky chips? Notice the words ""perfectly"" and ""immaculate"". No, there are not many restaurants with the courage to deliver a menu based on the very sound theory that less is more; that a good kitchen is much better off cooking steak rather than mucking around with all manner of fashionable, cheffy malarkey. So, we take our hats off to our fantastic team, for helping us bring The Venue Sreakhouse to Barcelona.

Our goal is to make Ecuadorean flavors known to the world. And while we do it we are pet friendly. We serve eggs benedict, pancakes, specialty coffee, cebiches (or ceviche, we serve it whichever way you like to spell it really...), seafood, avotoast, toast, fruit juices, lemonade and much more.

The 360 degree view is that spectacular, the sea and the city at your feet, the encircling hills in the distance. It has certainly attracted its share of architects, actors, and artists. But this high-end, luxury restaurant does everything in its power to distract you. The fittings are elegant and modern, the Catalan food (emphasis on fish) with its international influences right up there with the standards expected of a restaurant in Barcelona now. Dishes include starter of cod and lobster envelopes with black olive oil and mixed veg and main course of seabass with sauteed greens, shiitake, rice noodles, soya and sesame. Wines and service are very good, too.

The restaurant appreciates the bounty of local farms and seasonality, preparing local flavors with original recipes through modern presentations. Ali Ocakbaşı offers its guests unique flavors with the most natural aromas grilled on the fireside or in wood fire ovens. Cooperating with family breeding farms, the restaurant focuses on sustainability by supporting the geographically marked endemic species of the region. Every year, it contributes to reforestation as much as the carbon footprint of its brand. Ali Ocakbaşı aspires to the best tastes and the most enjoyable gourmet experience. With a qualified team and a great menu filled with classic, eclectic, and inventive fare, the restaurant continues to welcome local and foreign guests who want to spend every moment of the day in its branches located in Gümüşsuyu, Kuruçeşme, Karaköy and Suadiye where they will enjoy the city. Ali Ocakbaşı offers this unique gastronomy experience also in Europe, with its branch in Amsterdam. Now we are coming to Barcelona.","Vegetarian friendly","Halal",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"barcelona@aliocakbasi.com","Restaurants",,"Reservations","Outdoor
